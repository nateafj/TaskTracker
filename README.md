Before starting the creation of the application I wanted to make sure there was a registration page that lead to the actual app itself

My mentor gave me a resource to watch a code along that was set up to help work with express and node

To begin I imported the package.json file dependencies info VSCODE the packages used were: body-parser, ejs,  express, express-validator, and nodemon

Moving to the actual APP.js file I went ahead and began my file imports to usable variables on the page. IE: const express = require(‘express’)

I started with a simple UI to represent the homepage of the app with a register button to make an account which was linked to register.js

making the requests for page folders in the javascript code was giving me enormous trouble because my code seemed to be the exact same as the code along but I was using template literal ticks  in the methods parameters instead of regular quotation marks. This was just resolved by comparing the differences in my code.

After finishing my registration page I began to code the task tracker portion of the app. For reference I found a youtube code along that had the functionality I needed
